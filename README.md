# Face-Mask-Recognition
The Face Mask app has been designed to check if the User is wearning mask or not.
We will be training the model with face mask images as well as non-mask images .
The webcam will be opened to see if the person is wearing mask or not and draw a square around the face which will show the percentage of wearning a mask or not

# Dataset and Modelling
We are coding two files where one file will be used to check if the user is wearing a mask or not and the other file will be used to invoke the webcam and apply the mask detection techniques.
The app identifies the facial features and then checks if the user is wearing mask or not.
We will use the model that was obtained from mask detector and add them with MobileNet model which will enable to detect the mask worn faces as well as run the video by invoking webcam.
Streamlit was used to develop the model and it can be run on the localhost.
